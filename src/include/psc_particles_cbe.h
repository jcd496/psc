///
/// As Kai begins to implement his 'patch' system from libmrc, it becomes
/// less important that the cell have separate data structures. As this point,
/// there are two things which prevent us from just being able to use the
/// the default C particles base: we need the particles to be stored in
/// 16 byte aligned memory; it makes life a great deal easier if each particle
/// is a multiple of 16 bytes. The memory alignment issue could easily be
/// resolved by using posix_memalign in the C particles base. It might end up
/// being slower to allocate the memory (default is 8 in glibc), but it might
/// (possibly but unlikely) result in an overall speed increase. The issue
/// of padding is significantly more difficult. Basically, we need to get rid
/// of one of the standard particle attributes. Obviously, the positions and
/// momenta need to stay. That leaves us with somehow reducing qni,mni,and wni
/// to just two variables. If these two issues can be solved, we can do away
/// with the PARTICLES_CBE base.
